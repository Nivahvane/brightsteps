              {
                tip: "Narrate your day as you go. Describe what you're doing while cooking, cleaning, or getting dressed. This constant exposure to language helps children ages 2-6 build vocabulary naturally.",
                activity: "During snack time today, name each item as you prepare it. 'I'm cutting the apple. The apple is red. Let's put it on the blue plate.' Encourage your child to repeat the words."
              },
              {
                tip: "Ask open-ended questions instead of yes/no questions. Rather than 'Did you have fun?', try 'What was your favorite part of playing outside?'",
                activity: "At dinner, ask your child to tell you about three things they saw today. Give them time to think and respond, even if it takes a while."
              },
              {
                tip: "Silence is golden in conversation. When your child is trying to form words or tell a story, resist the urge to finish their sentences. That patient pause tells them: 'I believe you can do this. Your words matter.'",
                activity: "During one conversation today, count to 5 in your head before responding when your child pauses. Notice how they often find the words they're searching for when given time and space."
              }
            ],
            Behavior: [
              {
                tip: "Give specific praise instead of general praise. Rather than 'Good job!', try 'I noticed you shared your toy with your sister. That was very kind.'",
                activity: "Today, catch your child doing something positive and describe exactly what they did well. Watch how they beam with pride!"
              },
              {
                tip: "Offer limited choices to build independence. Instead of 'What do you want to wear?', try 'Do you want the blue shirt or the red shirt?'",
                activity: "Give your child two choices at three different times today - for clothes, snacks, or activities. Notice how this reduces conflicts."
              },
              {
                tip: "Connection before correction. When your child misbehaves, they often need closeness more than consequences. A gentle touch, getting eye-level, or a calm 'I see you're having a hard time' can shift the entire moment.",
                activity: "Next time your child acts out, pause and ask yourself: 'What do they need right now?' Try offering a hug or sitting close before addressing the behavior. Notice the difference."
              }
            ],
            Bonding: [
              {
                tip: "Get down to their level. Physically kneeling or sitting to be at eye level with your child shows them they have your full attention and makes conversations more meaningful.",
                activity: "Set aside 10 minutes today for 'floor time.' Sit on the floor and let your child lead the play. Follow their imagination wherever it goes."
              },
              {
                tip: "Create small rituals that are just yours. A special handshake, a bedtime song, or a silly dance can become cherished memories.",
                activity: "Invent a simple 'good morning' ritual with your child today. It could be a special hug, a song, or high-fives. Do it again tomorrow!"
              },
              {
                tip: "You don't have to be perfect to be the perfect parent for your child. They don't need your perfection—they need your presence. When you mess up, a simple 'I'm sorry, let's try again' teaches them grace.",
                activity: "If you lose patience today, model repair. Say 'Mommy/Daddy got frustrated and that wasn't kind. I'm sorry. Can we start over?' Show them that mistakes don't define us."
              }
            ],
            Faith: [
              {
                tip: "Model gratitude throughout the day. When children hear you express thankfulness for simple things, they learn to notice blessings too.",
                activity: "Before bed, share three things you're each grateful for today. Make it a conversation, not a quiz. Share yours first to model it."
              },
              {
                tip: "Answer spiritual questions simply and honestly. It's okay to say 'That's a great question. Let me think about that.' Children appreciate authenticity.",
                activity: "If your child asks a question about faith today, listen fully before answering. Ask them what they think first - their insights might surprise you."
              },
              {
                tip: "Sabbath rest isn't just about what we don't do—it's about being present with the ones we love. Even 15 minutes of unhurried time teaches children that people matter more than tasks, and rest is sacred.",
                activity: "This week, create a 'rest moment' with your child. No screens, no rush. Just sitting together, maybe in nature, talking about what made you smile this week. Let them feel the peace of simply being."
              }
            ],
            Learning: [
              {
                tip: "Turn everyday moments into learning opportunities. Sorting laundry teaches colors, setting the table teaches counting, cooking teaches measurements.",
                activity: "While preparing a meal, let your child help with one simple task. Count the ingredients together, talk about colors and textures, and celebrate their help."
              },
              {
                tip: "Follow your child's interests. If they love trucks, read books about trucks, count trucks, draw trucks. Learning accelerates when curiosity leads.",
                activity: "Notice what your child is fascinated by today. Spend 15 minutes exploring that interest together - through play, questions, or a simple activity."
