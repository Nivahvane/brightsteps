            Speech: [
              {
                tip: "Narrate your day as you go. Describe what you're doing while cooking, cleaning, or getting dressed. This constant exposure to language helps children ages 2-6 build vocabulary naturally.",
                activity: "During snack time today, name each item as you prepare it. 'I'm cutting the apple. The apple is red. Let's put it on the blue plate.' Encourage your child to repeat the words."
              },
              {
                tip: "Ask open-ended questions instead of yes/no questions. Rather than 'Did you have fun?', try 'What was your favorite part of playing outside?'",
                activity: "At dinner, ask your child to tell you about three things they saw today. Give them time to think and respond, even if it takes a while."
              },
              {
                tip: "Silence is golden in conversation. When your child is trying to form words or tell a story, resist the urge to finish their sentences. That patient pause tells them: 'I believe you can do this. Your words matter.'",
                activity: "During one conversation today, count to 5 in your head before responding when your child pauses. Notice how they often find the words they're searching for when given time and space."
              }
            ],
            Behavior: [
              {
                tip: "Give specific praise instead of general praise. Rather than 'Good job!', try 'I noticed you shared your toy with your sister. That was very kind.'",
                activity: "Today, catch your child doing something positive and describe exactly what they did well. Watch how they beam with pride!"
              },
              {
                tip: "Offer limited choices to build independence. Instead of 'What do you want to wear?', try 'Do you want the blue shirt or the red shirt?'",
                activity: "Give your child two choices at three different times today - for clothes, snacks, or activities. Notice how this reduces conflicts."
              },
              {
                tip: "Connection before correction. When your child misbehaves, they often need closeness more than consequences. A gentle touch, getting eye-level, or a calm 'I see you're having a hard time' can shift the entire moment.",
                activity: "Next time your child acts out, pause and ask yourself: 'What do they need right now?' Try offering a hug or sitting close before addressing the behavior. Notice the difference."
              }
            ],
            Bonding: [
              {
                tip: "Get down to their level. Physically kneeling or sitting to be at eye level with your child shows them they have your full attention and makes conversations more meaningful.",
                activity: "Set aside 10 minutes today for 'floor time.' Sit on the floor and let your child lead the play. Follow their imagination wherever it goes."
              },
              {
                tip: "Create small rituals that are just yours. A special handshake, a bedtime song, or a silly dance can become cherished memories.",
                activity: "Invent a simple 'good morning' ritual with your child today. It could be a special hug, a song, or high-fives. Do it again tomorrow!"
              },
              {
                tip: "You don't have to be perfect to be the perfect parent for your child. They don't need your perfection—they need your presence. When you mess up, a simple 'I'm sorry, let's try again' teaches them grace.",
                activity: "If you lose patience today, model repair. Say 'Mommy/Daddy got frustrated and that wasn't kind. I'm sorry. Can we start over?' Show them that mistakes don't define us."
              }
            ],
            Faith: [
              {
                tip: "Model gratitude throughout the day. When children hear you express thankfulness for simple things, they learn to notice blessings too.",
                activity: "Before bed, share three things you're each grateful for today. Make it a conversation, not a quiz. Share yours first to model it."
